In her role, Darcy has been committed to applying the finest scientific methods to address California’s management issues. Since her start with the State Water Contractors (SWC) in 2018, she has directed the funding of over $10 million towards research projects aimed at filling knowledge gaps in the Bay-Delta system and its watersheds. This investment is crucial for demystifying how to maintain a thriving estuarine ecosystem that also serves as a vital water source for millions and an irrigation system for vast farmlands. Key to this mission is the restoration of extensive tidal marshes, floodplains, and salmonid habitats in the Delta and its rivers.

His 15-year journey as an aquatic ecologist at Everglades National Park saw him leading a team that tracked the park’s ecological recovery. Prior to this, as Research Director at the South Florida Water Management District, he managed a large team of scientists dedicated to ecosystem restoration research. Educationally, Nick holds a B.S. and M.S. in biology from the University of West Florida and earned his Ph.D. in microbial ecology at Oregon State University. His academic path led him to the University of Mississippi, where he became a tenured Associate Professor of Biology. Now in Florida, he is an affiliate faculty member at Florida Atlantic University and the University of Florida. Nick’s commitment to environmental conservation is evident in his five-year tenure on the Sierra Club’s national Board of Directors, where he served as Vice-President and Treasurer, contributing to the governance of the historic 120-year-old organization with over 750,000 members.</div>

              <p class="d-none d-print-block">Nick Aumen has been a driving force in the Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Sciences program under the U.S. Geological Survey, focusing on the restoration of this vital ecosystem. His 15-year journey as an aquatic ecologist at Everglades National Park saw him leading a team that tracked the park’s ecological recovery. Prior to this, as Research Director at the South Florida Water Management District, he managed a large team of scientists dedicated to ecosystem restoration research. Educationally, Nick holds a B.S. and M.S. in biology from the University of West Florida and earned his Ph.D. in microbial ecology at Oregon State University. His academic path led him to the University of Mississippi, where he became a tenured Associate Professor of Biology. Now in Florida, he is an affiliate faculty member at Florida Atlantic University and the University of Florida. Nick’s commitment to environmental conservation is evident in his five-year tenure on the Sierra Club’s national Board of Directors, where he served as Vice-President and Treasurer, contributing to the governance of the historic 120-year-old organization with over 750,000 members.</p>

<p class="mb-0">It is possible you may be contacted by a company claiming to be the official housing bureau for this conference. These companies contact conference exhibitors and attendees, telling them the guest room block is sold out at the host hotel. The company then quotes a rate at another hotel, claiming it is an official room block and that you must reserve through them to get discounted rates. They ask for your credit card information so they can make a reservation for you. <strong>DO NOT FALL FOR THIS</strong> or you will lose your money. This scam is affecting conferences all over the country. No matter what meeting you attend, always use the hotel reservation links provided on the host organization’s website.</p>
