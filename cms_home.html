"> Tropical savanna ecosystems play a major role in the global carbon budget, however, their ability to store and
                                             sequester carbon, and the combined impacts of fire regimes and vegetation
                                             dynamics on these systems, are uncertain due to anthropogenic activities
                                             and climate change. The development of an open-source multi-scale data
                                             fusion, prototype carbon monitoring system (CMS), for accurately mapping
                                             tropical savanna aboveground carbon (AGC) over broad spatial scales and
                                             time spans (4D) is crucial for monitoring vegetation and fire interactions
                                             as well as for understanding the role of fire in the carbon cycle in these
                                             ecosystems. New sensors onboard the International Space Station (ISS) such
                                             as Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide new
                                             opportunities to monitor AGC and ecosystem status globally. However, to
                                             date, little is known about the capability of GEDI alone or combined with
                                             optical [e.g. Landsat OLI 8 (L8)] and microwave data [e.g.
                                             ALOS-2/PALSAR-2], for wall-to-wall multi-layer AGC mapping and monitoring
                                             in tropical savanna ecosystems from space at high spatial and temporal
                                             resolutions. This project is focused on the Brazilian tropical Savanna
                                             (Cerrado) as it is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and
                                             also one of the most threatened. The overall objective of this project is
                                             to develop an open-source multi-scale data fusion, prototype carbon
                                             monitoring system (CMS), for 4D (space-time; CMS4D) wall-to-wall
                                             multi-layer AGC dynamics mapping and monitoring in the Cerrado. Herein, we
                                             propose four specific objectives (O), as follows:

                                             This proposed work will advance NASA Research Priorities in Earth Science
                                             and will directly address three NASA Earth Science objectives as well as
                                             the CMS ST solicitation. We will leverage NASA’s GEDI, L8, and JAXA’s
                                             ALOS-2 data, advanced statistical modeling methods, including machine
                                             learning algorithms for AGC monitoring in Cerrado. An updated version of
                                             the rGEDI package and a new Google Earth Engine App will be developed in
                                             this project.
                                             The project accesses and responds to stakeholder needs through its
                                             partnering with several entities in Brazil, including WWF, Embrapa and
                                             ICMBio. Our project will deliver geospatially explicit, methodologically
                                             consistent, and transparent AGCs, AGCc and AGCt maps with uncertainty
                                             estimates in Cerrado. Overall, the prototype CMS from this project will
                                             enable the full use of cutting-edge remote sensing datasets to monitor AGC
                                             dynamics, better understand vegetation and fire interactions in the
                                             Cerrado, and assist in its sustainable conservation and management into the
                                             future.

                                In this project, our prototype CMS is divided into three sections; each section will address one or more of our four scientific questions and proposed objectives. First, field and simulated GEDI data are related at the footprint level for deriving a new set of models for estimating AGC from GEDI data (objective #1) (a), and therefore improve total AGC estimation in Cerrado. Second, GEDI will be combined with Landsat 8 OLI or ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 for wall-to-wall mapping multi-layer vegetation AGC across the biome (b) (objective #2). Third, models developed in the previous step will be applied across time and space for monitoring multi-layer AGC dynamics and fire interactions from 2019 to 2025 and to support stakeholders on integrated fire management activities in Cerrado (objective #3-4) (c).

                                   SCNPK (19°12'-34'S, 43°27'-38'W) is located in the southeast portion of the Cerrado biome, state of Minas Gerais. The vegetation in SCNPK varies and comprises different physiognomies, from open grasslands (“Campo Limpo”) at altitudes below 1,000 m to savanna formations with different proportions of woody cover (“Campo Sujo”, “Campo Cerrado” and “Cerrado sensu stricto”) and forest formations (“Cerradão”), all classified as part of the Cerrado sensu lato (OliveiraFilho and Ratter, 2002); above 1,000 m are found the rupestrian grasslands (Benites et al., 2003).

                                   The CVNPK (13°51'-14°10'S, 47°25'-42'W) encompasses five municipalities in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Within a mountainous region, the altitude in CVNPK ranges from 620 to 1,700 m a.s.l., and the climate is characterized as tropical and sub-humid (AW) (Alvares et al., 2013). The landscape is formed by mosaics of different vegetation types (Ribeiro and Walter, 2008) characterized by a predominance of forest formations at low elevations and Cerrado with montane savannas at high elevations (Felfili et al. 2007). Wet and dry grasslands and savannas occur in between streams, covering most of the landscape. At the northwest edge of the park, dry deciduous forests are found, whereas at the southwest edge riparian evergreen forests are most common (Flores et al., 2020). In total, the CVNPK presents 77% of savanna formation, and about 10% corresponds to the forest fragments (Porto et al., 2011).

                                   The PNF (19° 20'S and 44° 20'W) is located in the municipality of Paraopeba, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It is comprised of 150 ha remnants of Cerrado vegetation, including both savanna (e.g. Cerrado sensu stricto) and forest formations (e.g.Cerradão) (Neri et al., 2013).
